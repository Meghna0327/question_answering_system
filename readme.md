# Legislative QA System using RAG + Knowledge Graphs

We are planning to build a **Question-Answering platform for the legislative domain** by combining **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Knowledge Graphs** to provide **contextually rich, accurate answers to legal questions**.

Our goal is to enable intelligent interaction with large collections of legal documents and provide detailed responses grounded in factual knowledge.
